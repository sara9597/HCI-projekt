A year later, she found a neighborhood piano teacher to take her son beyond simple scales. Schoenberg’s love of old films led him to Benny Goodman, and his love of Goodman’s music made Schoenberg a jazz fan in the early 1970s. Jazz’s heyday as a popular music form was over by that point, and while Schoenberg was collecting classic 78 rpm records by jazz originators like Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, and “Fats” Waller, most of his peers were busy listening to rock and roll and folk music.\",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"Scholars disagree over how to best define jazz.

Also at the Jazz Museum, the fifteen year-old met Benny Goodman again, while working on the Museum’s Goodman exhibit. Later, two producers from the radio station WBAI were referred to Schoenberg as the local jazz expert, while researching an upcoming show on jazz music.

While at school, Schoenberg got a job playing sax in Eddie Durham’s jazz quartet. “I’d been jamming, sitting in and waiting for an opportunity,” Schoenberg said recently. “I was one of a very small group of young guys interested in these great old jazz players at the time. \",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"They were happy to have somebody who knew all the old songs.” Playing with Durham, one of the original members of the Count Basie band, gave Schoenberg opportunities to meet and work with jazz musicians such as Al Casey, Sammy Price, Roy Eldridge, Jabbo Smith, Eddie Barefield, Jo Jones, and Panama Francis. After two years at Manhattan School of Music, Schoenberg switched his major to saxophone. In 1979, he produced a Charlie Parker and Lester Young tribute at Carnegie Recital Hall, arranging the songs, gathering the musicians, and performing with them.

Mozart was the winner, consistently boosting test scores. Next, the investigators checked to see if the effect was specific to classical music or if any form of music would enhance mental performance.

It's a sour note, but it's hardly a requiem for the theory that music may boost cognitive function. In fact, the divergent results should serve as a prelude to additional research.
