Schoenberg’s love of old films led him to Benny Goodman, and his love of Goodman’s music made Schoenberg a jazz fan in the early 1970s.

Also at the Jazz Museum, the fifteen year-old met Benny Goodman again, while working on the Museum’s Goodman exhibit. Later, two producers from the radio station WBAI were referred to Schoenberg as the local jazz expert, while researching an upcoming show on jazz music.

While at school, Schoenberg got a job playing sax in Eddie Durham’s jazz quartet. “I’d been jamming, sitting in and waiting for an opportunity,” Schoenberg said recently. “I was one of a very small group of young guys interested in these great old jazz players at the time. \",\"marks\":[],\"data\":{}}],\"data\":{}},{\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\",\"content\":[{\"nodeType\":\"text\",\"value\":\"They were happy to have somebody who knew all the old songs.” Playing with Durham, one of the original members of the Count Basie band, gave Schoenberg opportunities to meet and work with jazz musicians such as Al Casey, Sammy Price, Roy Eldridge, Jabbo Smith, Eddie Barefield, Jo Jones, and Panama Francis. After two years at Manhattan School of Music, Schoenberg switched his major to saxophone. In 1979, he produced a Charlie Parker and Lester Young tribute at Carnegie Recital Hall, arranging the songs, gathering the musicians, and performing with them. The concert featured Howard McGhee, Joe Albany, Buddy Anderson, Dickey Wells, Eddie Bert, Herb Ellis and Mel Lewis among others.

In their first study, they administered standard IQ test questions to three groups of college students, comparing those who had spent 10 minutes listening to a Mozart piano sonata with a group that had been listening to a relaxation tape and one that had been waiting in silence. Mozart was the winner, consistently boosting test scores. Next, the investigators checked to see if the effect was specific to classical music or if any form of music would enhance mental performance.

It's not clear, but the researchers speculated that listening to music helps organize the firing of nerve cells in the right half of the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain responsible for higher functions. According to this construct, music — or at least some forms of music — acts as an \\\"exercise\\\" that warms up selected brain cells, allowing them to process information more efficiently. It's an interesting theory, but before you rush out to stock up on recordings of Mozart's music, you should know that even in the original research, the \\\"Mozart effect\\\" was modest (8 to 9 IQ points) and temporary (15 minutes). And in reviewing 16 studies of Mozart's music and human cognitive function, a Harvard psychologist concluded that the effect was even smaller, amounting to no more than 2.1 IQ points. It's a sour note, but it's hardly a requiem for the theory that music may boost cognitive function. In fact, the divergent results should serve as a prelude to additional research. And even if listening to music turns out to have little long-term effect on cognition, a 2010 review reported that learning to play an instrument may enhance the brain's ability to master tasks involving language skills, memory, and attention.\\n\\n It's not possible to say.
